**Volumetric video workshop**

This workshop will introduce you to the relatively new and fast-growing medium: Free Viewpoint Video (FVV). Focused on breadth, it will cover its pros and cons, technical workflows, trends and current research and products landscape. It also includes a hands-on part about post-processing of FVV assets in SideFX Houdini.

Whether you are interested in computer vision / graphics, holograms, multi-camera setups or just want to see a couple of Houdini tricks, make sure to take part in it!

A basic familiarity with computer vision, graphics and Houdini is recommended, but not required.

_For Filmakademie, 2021_
